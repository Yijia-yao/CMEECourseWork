# CMEE

This repository contains some coursework and practical materials for the **Living Planet with Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE)** programme at **Imperial College London**.


ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘‹Welcome to my **CMEE Coursework Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of all the coding exercises, data analyses, and modelling projects Iâ€™ve worked on as part of the *Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE)* MSc at Imperial College London.  

Itâ€™s basically a record of my journey learning how to think like a computational biologist â€” from writing Bash scripts and analysing data in R, to building models in Python.  
Each week focuses on a different skill, and together they cover everything from UNIX basics to ecological modelling and statistics.

## Feel free to explore the structure below ðŸ‘‡

#  Week1 Learning Goals
- Learning **UNIX**, **R**, and **Python**  
- Writing reproducible, modular, and well-organized code  
- Applying computational methods to biological datasets  
- Practising good coding and data management workflows  

Programming empowers biologists to:
- Perform custom analyses not covered by existing software  
- Ensure reproducibility and transparency  
- Improve computational efficiency and scientific rigor
